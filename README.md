Welcome to Dailylist Odoo, an Odoo application that integrates with Spotify and Genius to provide an enriched musical experience.

## üìã Description

Dailylist Odoo allows users to search for artists, explore albums, and get song lyrics directly from Odoo. It uses the Spotify API to search and retrieve music information and the Genius API to fetch song lyrics.

## üöÄ Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/rauljimm/dailylist-odoo.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd dailylist-odoo
    ```
3. Install the necessary dependencies:
    ```bash

## üîß Configuration

To make the Spotify integration work, you will need to configure your Spotify API credentials in the `spotipy_connector.py` file.

1. Open the `spotipy_connector.py` file located in the `util` directory.
2. Replace `'INSERT-HERE-YOUR-CLIENT-ID'` and `'INSERT-HERE-YOUR-CLIENT-SECRET'` with your Spotify credentials:

    ```python
    self.client_credentials_manager = SpotifyClientCredentials(
        client_id='INSERT-HERE-YOUR-CLIENT-ID',
        client_secret='INSERT-HERE-YOUR-CLIENT-SECRET'
    )
    ```
